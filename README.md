# TrustChain Simulator
This repository contains two TrustChain simulations built with OMNeT++, the goal of these simulations is to study and evaluate a better defence system against double-spending attack. The two simulations and the results collected will be used to write my master thesis.

## Development Phases
- [x] Develop on paper system architecture
- [x] Created standard implementation
- [x] Implemented malicious node/s (attack)
- [x] Develop detenction performance logging system
- [x] Modify and run software on distributed super computer cluster
- [ ] Update the standard implementation with defence system

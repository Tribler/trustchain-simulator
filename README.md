# TrustChain Simulator
The programs present in this repository are used simulate the TrustChain technology described in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17318988) and are built with the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) simulation framework.


## Project Goal
The goal of these simulations is to study and evaluate a better defence system against double-spending attack.  
The simulations and the results collected will be used to write and defend my master thesis at TuDelft.

## TrustChain Description
The TrustChain is a protocol for a share interconnected data structure with enormous potential, it is designed to record transactions among strangers without central control, and it is able to support high transaction volumes.  

This system is highly scalable while maintaining stable performance independent of the numbers of active users, which is hard to achieve in blockchain structure where there is a unique shared ledger.  
(Bitcoin can achieve between **3.3 and 7** transactions per second, the Visa system does maximum **24,000** transacions/s and the  protocol described here has **no theoretical limit**.)  
This is enabled by a network composed of individual semi-independent ledger (every node has it's own) and rules that define how these are constructed.   

A transaction between two parties creates a new element in both the participantâ€™s ledger and this new element contains some pieces of information like the value of transaction itself, details of the previous element in the ledger and signatures of both the parties.
 

## Development Phases
- [x] Develop on paper system architecture
- [x] Created standard implementation
- [x] Implemented malicious node/s (attack)
- [x] Develop detenction performance logging system
- [x] Modify and run software on distributed super computer cluster
- [x] Test simulator in different scenarios and analyse data
- [x] Update the simulator to replicate the TrustChain testing done on [Tribler](https://github.com/Tribler/tribler)
- [ ] Study efficient algorithms and methodology to improve the performance of detection time
- [ ] Validate on paper the solution/s
- [ ] Update the standard implementation with new defence system

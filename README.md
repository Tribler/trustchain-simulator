# TrustChain Simulator
This repository contains two TrustChain simulations built with OMNeT++, the goal of these simulations is to study and evaluate a better defence system against double-spending attack. The two simulations and the results collected will be used to write my master thesis.

## Development Phases
- [x] Created standard implementation
- [ ] Implemented malicious node/s (attack)
- [ ] Develop detenction performance logging system
- [ ] Modify the standard implementation with defence system

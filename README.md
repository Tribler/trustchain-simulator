# TrustChain Simulator
This repository (will) contains three TrustChain simulations built with OMNeT++.

## The goal
The goal of these simulations is to study and evaluate a better defence system against double-spending attack.  
The simulations and the results collected will be used to write my master thesis at TuDelft.

## Development Phases
- [x] Develop on paper system architecture
- [x] Created standard implementation
- [x] Implemented malicious node/s (attack)
- [x] Develop detenction performance logging system
- [x] Modify and run software on distributed super computer cluster
- [x] Test simulator in different scenarios and analyse data
- [x] Update the simulator to replicate the TrustChain testing done on [Tribler](https://github.com/Tribler/tribler)
- [ ] Study efficient algorithms and methodology to improve the performance of detection time
- [ ] Validate on paper the solution/s
- [ ] Update the standard implementation with new defence system
